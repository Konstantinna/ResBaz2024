# Kia ora!
Thank you for signing up for the ResBaz session Jupyter Notebooks for Reproducible Research! 

This session is designed as an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks or a refresher for those of you who have had a bit of introductory exposure but have yet to explore notebooks in detail. 
We will discuss why and how Jupyter Notebooks can fit into the Research Lifecycle and can support reproducible research.

We will use a web-based version of Jupyter Notebooks called JupyterLite so you do not need to download or install any software before the session. 

After the intro, you will see how to use JupyterLite for exploratory data analysis using an open data research dataset on Aphantasia shared on OSF (Brainbridge et al., 2021). https://osf.io/a8yb3

You can choose to sit back and watch or follow along via the exercise notebook uploaded on the GitHub repo.
